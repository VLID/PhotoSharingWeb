# Photo Sharing Platform
### Platform [Demo](https://goo.gl/J2u0cL)
## Introduction
This platform is a small social platform. People can share their photos to the public. They need to sign up first, then they can login to their own account to upload the photos. I use PHP, MySQL, Cookies/Sessions, and Google Map API to develop this website.

### Key features:
* Security
	* Secured sign up and login system using the Regular Expression to limit what users can type in and store the hashed value of user's password to the database.
	* Users can only upload the image-type files to the database, not the scripting files.
	* Protect the website from the illegal input.
* The website can show the location map of the photo taken by mobile phone using Google Map API.
* Users can add description to their photo and can choose which photo they would like to share to the public.

## Thoughts
During developing this website, I use the Bootstrap for styles of my website. Also, I learn the importance of web security and strategies to prevent some illegal attack. Never ever forget to build a secured web system.
